# Swarm LED Blink
This project uses 2 Arduino boars with HC-05 Bluetooth Modules connected to each one. One of them is master and the other is slave. The master LED blinks ON and OFF on its own at an interval of 5 seconds. This data is transferred over the Bluetooth to the slave LED, which then imitates the master's operation.
