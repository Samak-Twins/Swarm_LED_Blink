# Swarm LEDs
This project uses 2 Arduino boars with HC-05 Bluetooth Modules connected to each one. One of them is Master and the other is Slave. The Master LED blinks ON and OFF on its own at an interval of 5 seconds. This data is transferred over the Bluetooth to the Slave LED, which then imitates the master's operation.
